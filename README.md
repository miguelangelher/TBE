# TBE
TBE, initials of Time Based Enumeration is a tool which goal is performing users enumeration based on the authentication server response time. Sometimes, the web applications perform the user autentication in a two step based process. Firtly, they look for the user and if it exists in the database, they ask for the password. This approach, even when it shorten the response time in case the user were not present, causes the posibility of a time based enumeration. Thus, depending on the response time, the attacker knows if the user is a valid one or not. This tool automates this process being capable of executing multiple threads and fuzz a request using a dictionary
